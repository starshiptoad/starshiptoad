- 👋 Hi, I’m @starshiptoad
- 👀 I am currently interested in creating my personal Outlook plugin (addin) to make my daily work with emails, attachments and sorting them away easier and more bearable.

       I would also like to learn Python, as I consider Python to be the modern Basic.
       Unfortunately, I don't have the time to really delve into the subject.
       In the course of time, I would like to create a program in Python to automatically
       download freely available aerial images based on WMS data together with GDAL.
